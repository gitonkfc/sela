== Description ==

A theme for non-profits, organizations, and schools.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Ixion includes support for many Jetpack (jetpack.me) features:

* Featured Content
* Testimonials
* Social Links Menu
* Infinite Scroll

== Setting Up Your Front Page ==

When you first activate Ixion, your homepage displays posts in a traditional blog format. To set up your homepage, follow these steps:

1) Create a page.
2) Go to the Customizer’s Static Front Page panel and set “Front page displays” to “A static page.”
3) Select the page created in Step One as “Front page,” and choose another page as “Posts page” to display your blog posts.

Ixion's front page displays, in order:

* The site header;
* the Site Tagline with optional Header Image and Call-to-Action Button;
* Featured Content;
* the page title and content, if set, and the five most recent Posts;
* the sidebar;
* and the site footer.


== Site Tagline ==

The site tagline appears on the front page of your site, and is a great place to add a brief welcome. HTML cannot be used in the tagline.


== Theme Options ==

Add a call-to-action button to your front page underneath the Site Tagline as seen on the demo. Go to Customize → Theme Options to add the URL and text to your call-to-action button.


== Featured Content ==

Featured Content (only available with Jetpack: jetpack.me) is shown on the front page below the Site Tagline area. To add a post or page to Featured Content, give it the tag "featured," or another tag of your choosing set from Customize → Featured Content.


== Featured Images ==

Ixion supports prominent Featured Images on single posts and pages at full width and an unlimited height.


== Custom Menus ==

-- Main Menu --

This theme has one main menu area called "Header." If you don't assign a custom menu to that area, your site's default page menu is displayed instead.

-- Social Links --

Ixion supports a Jetpack Social Links (jetpack.me) menu, which appears in the footer. Linking to any of the following sites will automatically display its icon in your menu:

CodePen					Digg
Dribbble				Dropbox
Facebook				Flickr
github 					Google+
Instagram				LinkedIn
Email (mailto: links)	Pinterest
Pocket					Polldaddy
Reddit					RSS Feed (urls with /feed/)
StumbleUpon				Tumblr
Twitter					Vimeo
WordPress				YouTube


== Widgets ==

-- Sidebar --

Ixion has a one-column or two-column layout. Add widgets to the sidebar area for a traditional two-column blog, or leave it blank for a sleek one-column style.

-- Footer Widget Areas --

Ixion also includes up to four optional widget areas in the footer.

Configure these widget areas from Customize → Widgets.


== Testimonials ==

Download Jetpack http://jetpack.me/ to activate this feature. Ixion features testimonials in two ways:

* The dedicated testimonial archive page displays all testimonials in reverse chronological order, with the newest displayed first.
* The Testimonial Shortcode allows you to display the testimonials wherever you want on your site.

To add a testimonial, go to Testimonials → Add New in your WP Admin dashboard. Testimonials are composed of the testimonial text, the name of the customer — added as testimonial title — and an image or logo, which can be added as a Featured Image.

-- Testimonial Archive Page --

The testimonial archive page can be found at https://ixiondemo.wordpress.com/testimonial/ — just replace https://ixiondemo.wordpress.com/ with the URL of your website. All testimonials are displayed on the testimonial archive page, which can be added to a Custom Menu using the Links Panel.

This page can be further customized by adding a title, intro text, and featured image via Customizer → Testimonials. This content will appear above the testimonials list.


== Page Templates ==

Ixion comes with a No Sidebar Page Template to give you more space for your content. It’s the perfect way to showcase a large gallery of images or a video.


== Extras ==

Ixion comes with a special CSS style for buttons. You can add the button class to your links in the HTML Editor or a Text Widget to create “call to action” buttons.

Sample code:
<a href="https://ixiondemo.wordpress.com/" class="button">Button</a>


== Additional Support ==

Ixion also supports the following features:

* Custom Logo
* Custom Backgrounds
